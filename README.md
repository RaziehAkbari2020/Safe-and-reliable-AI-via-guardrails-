The output of LLMs is fundamentally probabilistic, making it impossible to know in advance, or to guarantee the same response twice. This makes it difficult to put LLM-powered applications into production for industries with strict regulations or clients who require high consistency in application behavior. 

Fortunately, installing guardrails on your system gives you an additional layer of control in creating safe and reliable applications. Guardrails are safety mechanisms and validation tools built into AI applications, acting as a protective framework that prevents your application from revealing incorrect, irrelevant, or sensitive information.
